# Marvel Comics Web App Submission

## Implementation

This implementation follows all the requirements specified in the challenge:

- Displays a grid of Marvel comics fetched from the Marvel API
- Implements filtering functionality via a header menu based on format (Comic, Magazine, Digital Comic)
- Persists filter selection in LocalStorage for better user experience
- Shows a detailed modal with comic information when "More info" is clicked
- Features infinite scrolling for pagination with automatic data fetching
- Uses TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Has a responsive grid layout that works on different screen sizes
- Implements proper error handling for failed image loads and API errors
- Uses environment variables for API key management
- Implements utility functions for common operations (price formatting)
- Uses TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Implements keyboard navigation (ESC to close modal)
- Features smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Implements lazy loading for images
- Shows loading skeletons for better UX during data fetching

## Issues Faced and Solutions

1. Price Formatting
   - Issue: Handling various price formats and edge cases in the Marvel API response
   - Solution: Created a robust price formatting utility with proper edge case handling

2. Modal Animations
   - Issue: Implementing smooth and performant animations for the modal
   - Solution: Used Framer Motion 

3. Image Loading
   - Issue: Optimizing image loading performance
   - Solution: Implemented lazy loading with placeholder images and proper fallbacks

4. Loading States
   - Issue: Providing smooth transitions during data fetching
   - Solution: Implemented loading skeletons with Framer Motion animations
   - Created reusable SkeletonCard component
   - Optimized performance with hardware acceleration
   - Maintained consistent layout during loading
